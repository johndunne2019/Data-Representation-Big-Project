# Data-Representation-Big-Project
My project submission for the Data Representation module at GMIT 2020

I have created a MySQL database called stockbullfinder which will contain details on stock bulls that are used in for breeding in the suckler beef breeding cattle system in Ireland. I have sourced the bulls details from the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation bull search - https://webapp.icbf.com/v2/app/bull-search. 

I have created a table called bulls in the database that contains some basic information about each bull. The table has an auto incremented id for each bull which serves as the primary key followed by the bull's code and name, the bulls' breed and owner.

I intend to add a second table to the database later.

I have added below a screenshot of the bulls table when the describe command is run in MySQL.
